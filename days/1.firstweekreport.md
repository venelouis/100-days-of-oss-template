Week One (days 1-6)
Hello, friends, this is my first week report: 
1. The first think I did when I received the email about this event from github education was to know more about the event and the organization, English isn't my first language, so I think maybe it isnot the easiest thing to learn, besides I can understand everything with some patience I think. 
2. So I forked the repo into my github account and created a directory to put the "days descriptions md files" into it: https://github.com/venelouis/100-days-of-oss-template through many branches days.
3. I joined the open sauced plataform with github to do the beginners list: https://app.opensauced.pizza/workspaces/cff3f17b-f052-4686-85af-72971009136b , I highlited something i did, I don't know if I did it right, but it is there.
4. And finaly i did a simple one: https://app.opensauced.pizza/s/hackademia-learningjourney/github-pr-practice?hideBots=false and I highlited: https://oss.fyi/3G2YZbg
5.  I shared this event in a linkedin article in Portuguese, and my X profile, and others learning plataforms...
6. So I don't know if I am doing this very correct but I am trying, if anyone has acomplished this or is trying to do, please share, I want to see how you are doing this! I think it is enought for this week, see you next week. Thank you!
