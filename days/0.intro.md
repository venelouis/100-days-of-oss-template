### My 100 days of OSS 
Well in my age, all the responsabilities I have, many things to do... </br>
100 days of really relevant contribution is simply not possible for me right now in this moment of my life, and I don't want just commit anything to "check a day" [x], so I will try to make it something weekly.</br>
Alright, that been said, let's go!

day 3 update: it's not actualy day 3, if I would count just about days of production, it would be the first or the 2nd, sometimes (maybe all the time): "the time is just a illusion", I will try to do this at my own pace, dividing my work in some "days branches", and that's it, I think it will gonna work!
